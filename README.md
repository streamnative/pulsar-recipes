[//]: # (TODO README badges https://shields.io/)
[//]: # (TODO README summary description)

A cookbook of varied use-cases built atop of Apache Pulsar. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how Apache
Pulsar primitives can be combined to produce useful and novel behaviours while benefiting from Pulsar's inherent
reliability and scalability.

## Recipes

### Long Running Tasks
A distributed work queue for long-running tasks. This implementation attempts to minimise unnecessary communication
that might otherwise be generated by acknowledgement time-outs and subsequent message redeliveries. Instead, the system
uses keep-alive messages emitted at a user defined interval to check on task status. Users can choose to set a per-task
maximum execution duration and configure the number of times a failing task will be retried. An at-least-once guarantee
ensures that tasks are not lost in the event of failure, however, in such failure scenarios work may be repeated.

#### Terminology
* **Process**: An actionable implementation of work that takes input and yields an output.
* **Task**: A specific set of inputs that will have a process applied to them to yield a result.
* **Metadata**: Data pertaining to the execution of a process on a given task.
* **Worker**: A node that consumes tasks and processes them.
* **Client**: A participant that submits tasks for processing and consumes the results.

#### Methodology
* Tasks are submitted to a worker queue and are consumed by tasks workers for processing. Tasks
  are ACKed when there is no further processing to be performed on them. Tasks are NACKed in the
  event of a processing failure. There are intentionally no ACK timeouts.
* The state of tasks is tracked by task metadata entries. Metadata is updated whenever there is a
  task state transition, and also with a periodical keep-alive while the task is running.


#### Example

The following example demonstrates a (not-so-long-running) greeter process.

##### Shared data structures

```java
@Value
class Task {
    String name;
}

@Value
class Result {
    String greeting;
}
```

##### Client

```java
PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder()
    .serviceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
    .build();

Producer<Task> taskProducer = client.newProducer(Schema.JSON(Task.class))
    .topic("tasks")
    .enableBatching(false)
    .create();

Consumer<TaskMetadata> metadataConsumer = client.newConsumer(Schema.JSON(TaskMetadata.class))
    .topic("tasks-metadata")
    .subscriptionName("results-subscription")
    .subscribe();

String messageId = taskProducer.send(new Task("Dave")).toString();

Schema<Result> schema = Schema.JSON(Result.class);

while (true) {
    Message<TaskMetadata> message = metadataConsumer.receive();
        TaskMetadata taskMetadata = message.getValue();
    if (taskMetadata.getMessageId().equals(messageId)
        && taskMetadata.getState() == State.COMPLETED) {
        Result result = schema.decode(taskMetadata.getResult());
    }
}
```

##### Worker

```java
PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder()
    .serviceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
    .build();

TaskProcessor<Task, Result> process = process -> new Result("Hello " + process.getName());

TaskWorkerConfiguration<Task, Result> configuration = TaskWorkerConfiguration
    .builder(Schema.JSON(Task.class), Schema.JSON(Result.class))
    .taskTopic("tasks")
    .subscription("subscription")
    .build();

TaskWorker worker = TaskWorker.create(client, process, configuration);
```
